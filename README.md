This repository contains a Unity sample project that demonstrates how to use
[Minis], a MIDI extension for the Unity Input System, to control visual effects.

[Minis]: https://github.com/keijiro/Minis

This project also utilizes input binders and components from the
[VfxGraphAssets] package, which enables the use of the Input System in VFX
Graph without scripting.

Minis supports the Web MIDI API, which is available in [some modern browsers].
You can try the [Web build] using a Web MIDI-compatible browser.
